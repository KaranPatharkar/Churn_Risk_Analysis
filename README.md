# Churn_Risk_Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my recent Medium article, "Unlocking Customer Churn Risk Insights: A Data-Driven Analysis of an E-Commerce Dataset". 

  In this article, I conducted a churn risk analysis on a fictional e-commerce company's dataset, exploring various factors that may contribute to customer churn and developing a machine learning model to make customer churn predictions.  The analysis involved several steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and clustering to create customer segments with unique churn risk characteristics. 
  
  Through the use of visualizations and statistical techniques, I uncovered insights that can help businesses identify at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies.  To accompany the article, I have also included the Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used in the analysis, as well as the dataset used in the analysis. You are free to use this code and dataset for educational or personal purposes, but please note that any commercial use is strictly prohibited. 
  
  I hope you find this repository useful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me through my Medium account or via email.  Thank you for your interest in my work!
